R-code accompanying "Flexible asymmetric multivariate distributions based on two-piece univariate distributions"

We recommend installing the latest version of R to make sure all functions run properly. This code will later on be made available in an R-package.

For theoretical result on which this code is based, we refer to
  - Baillien, J., Gijbels, I. and Verhasselt, A. (2022). Flexible asymmetric multivariate distributions based on two-piece univariate distributions. The
    Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, to appear (with online Supplementary Material). DOI:10.1007/s10463-022-00842-6

The repository consists of 4 main parts:
  - Functions used in either simulation studies or practical examples. These will be made available either in a new R-package, or as an extension to the "QBAsyDist" package. These are the files "1Ddistributions.R", "FIM.R", "LCQBAdensity.R", "LCQBAfit.R", "rLCQBA.R" and "varcov_LCQBA.R".
  - Simulation studies. Results from simulation studies need to be stored locally. Directories to store and bundle these outputs need to be changed to their local counterpart. Run times might vary depending on the chosen model. This is the file "Simulations.R", plots based on this output are generated in "PlotsPaper.R".
  - Examples and plots. For examples, the data needs to be loaded in. Same holds for plots of simulations. Bundles output is loaded in from a local directory. Together with heatmaps and DD-plots, these are found in "PlotsPaper.R"
  - 2 scripts: one for fitting all possible (up to permutation) LCQBA-models considered here, one for calculating some measures of skewness for the discussed distributions. 

Comments are added to the functions, please read these to ensure proper use.
